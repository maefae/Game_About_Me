        <h2>Educational Background</h2>
        <!-- <p>My name is Megan Seibert-Hughes and I was born in Laredo Texas. I spent a good portion of my childhood traveling with my family, 
            but eventually I found myself living in Austin Texas by the age of 17. I went to Austin Community College for a few years before ultimately
            joining the military by age 20. Upon graduation of basic training, I transferred straight into UT Austin as Psychology major. 
            Unfortunately, the pandemic hit half way into my semester and I did not want to take college courses remotely, so I got the opportunity to work as a medical courier. 
            I also started my own pet sitting business whilst balancing the military. I'm tired of balancing three careers so that's why I decided to join Code Fellows 
            to hopefully gain the knowledge and experience necessary to get a foot in the door of the tech industry.

    <h2>Favorite color</h2>
        <p>It's difficult for me to choose a specific favorite color, but I tend to be drawn more towards the cooler side of the spectrum</p>

    <h2>Personal Experiences</h2>
        <p>To elaborate on the two truths and a lie game, I was not attacked by a bear. However, I do work for the military as a 
            Psychological Operations Specialist, and I did grow up next to a famous haunted house featured in the netflix series, "I am a killer"
